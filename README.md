# limoncellocheesecake
Serves 12-16
Crust:
1 ¾ Cups	Biscotti crumbs or vanilla wafer cookie crumbs
2 Tbsp	 Sugar
4 Tbsp	 Unsalted butter, melted

Filling:
32 oz	 Cream cheese, softened to room temperature
1¼ Cup	Sugar
4	 Eggs
¼ Cup	 Lemon juice
2 Tbsp	 Lemon zest
3 Tbsp	 Limoncello (Italian lemon-flavored liqueur)

To prepare the crust: Lightly grease a 9-inch Springform pan. Tightly wrap the bottom and sides of the pan with double thickness of heavy duty foil. In the bowl of a food processor, pulse biscotti or cookies to make fine crumbs. Measure out 1¾ Cups and place in a medium mixing bowl; store any remaining crumbs for another use. Add sugar and melted butter to crumbs in the bowl; mix well. Press crumb mixture evenly over the bottom and 1 inch up the sides of the prepared pan. Refrigerate while making filling.

To prepare the filling: Preheat oven to 350°. In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese until fluffy. Add sugar and beat well. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Add remaining filling ingredients and beat until smooth. Carefully pour into the pan, taking care not to disturb the crust. Place filled pan into a roasting pan with 2-3 inch sides and fill with hot water halfway up the side of the Springform pan. Bake in the water bath for 50-60 minutes.
